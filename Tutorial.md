# HTML5 & CSS Tutorial

Most Important tags to remember when it comes to HTML5: 
<!DOCTYPE html>     ->      This specifies what version of HTML is being used to the webpage
<html>      ->      The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document. The <html> tag represents the root of
<head>      ->      The <head> element is a container for all the head elements. The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more. 
                    The following elements can go inside the <head> element:
                                                                                  <title> (this element is required in an HTML document)
                                                                                  <style>
                                                                                  <base>
                                                                                  <link>
                                                                                  <meta>
                                                                                  <script>
                                                                                  <noscript>
<meta charset="UTF-8">      ->      That meta tag basically specifies what character set is your website written with. Here is a definition of UTF-8: UTF-8 (U from Universal Character Set + Transformation Formatâ€”8-bit) is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters
<body>      ->      The <body> tag defines the document's body. The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.
</html>     ->      This is the HTML tag that you end your HTML document with, it specifies the end of the document.
